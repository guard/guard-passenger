= Guard::Passenger

Guard::Passenger is the useful development server solution. The guard automatically starts Passenger and intelligently restarts the server when needed.

== Install

Please be sure to have {guard}[http://github.com/guard/guard] installed before continue.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-passenger

Add it to your Gemfile (inside test group):

    gem 'guard-passenger'

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

    guard init passenger

== Usage

Please read {guard usage doc}[http://github.com/guard/guard#readme]

== Guardfile

Passenger guard can be really be adapted to all kind of rack project with Passenger.
Please read {guard doc}[http://github.com/guard/guard#readme] for more info about Guardfile DSL.

=== Standard rails app

    guard 'passenger' do
      watch(%|lib/.*\.rb|)
      watch(%|config/.*\.rb|)
    end

=== Passenger standalone

Passenger standalone is used as default. You can pass options to the guard to disable or configure it. Guard::Passenger will start Passenger on startup and take it down on exit.
By default Passenger standalone is activated and port is set to 3000.

=== Ping

You can choose to ping localhost:port(/path) after Passenger has been restarted, it's done asynchronously so it won't block other guards execution. If you set :ping to true, it will ping localhost:3000/, it you set :ping to a String, it will append the path to localhost:3000/ for the ping.
If the ping responds with a non-5XX response, Passenger is considered as running, otherwise, there is probably a problem with Passenger.

=== Guard options

Guard::Passenger accepts some options for configuration.

    # :standalone    boolean            run Passenger standalone                (default: true)
    # :cli           string             options to pass to passenger command    (default: '--daemonize')
    # :notification  boolean            Notifications enabled                   (default: true)
    # :ping          boolean or string  ping localhost after Passenger restart  (default: false)
    # :sudo          boolean or string  start Passenger under sudo              (default: false)

    guard 'passenger', :standalone => false, :cli => '--daemonize --port 3001 --address my_app.local --environment production', :ping => '/foo', :sudo => 'rvmsudo' do
    end
